We're going to make some plotly plots.

## Load packages and data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

library(plotly)
```


Let's get some data.

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb =
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  select(
    borough = neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, price, room_type, lat, long, rating) %>% 
  filter(
    borough == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500
  ) %>% 
  drop_na(rating)
```

Let's make a scatterplot!!

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(
    text_label = str_c("Neighborhood: ", neighbourhood)
  ) %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, color = ~price, #X comes from the variable "lat"
    type = "scatter", mode = "markers", alpha = .5, text = ~text_label
  )
```

Can we make boxplots? Sure can!

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    y = ~price, color = ~neighbourhood,
    type = "box", colors = "viridis")
```

Can we make a bar plot?

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  count(neighbourhood) %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, n)) %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~n, 
    type = "bar")
```

## ggplotly...

(appropriate just for yourself instead of creating interactive plots for others)

```{r}
ggp_scatterplot = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = lat, y = long, color = price)) +
  geom_point()

ggplotly(ggp_scatterplot)
```
